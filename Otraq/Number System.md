Verbally, Otraq uses mixed-radix 6/100 but, in writing, it uses base 10 arabic numerals

numbers 1-99 are constructed by listing the digits in positional order in base 6, replacing zero with ne, ie. thane = (1\*6^1+0\*6^0 = 6). if multiple digits in a row are the same (unless it's 7), the second consonant is replaced with ', corresponding to a glottal stop that only exists with numbers. for numbers 100+, it is positional with each digit being the base-6 number times the number corresponding to the correct power of 100, with 0's in the positional order being skipped. 100 is zen, 10,000 is then, 1,000,000 is qen, 100,000,000 is zeqen, 10,000,000,000 is theqen, 1,000,000,000,000 is qe'en, and so on and so forth.

When writing, it is base-10 arabic numerals. the inanimate cardinal numbers are constructed by taking the animate cardinal and replacing the last vowel with o, ie thano or zo. the ordinals are constructed by taking the corresponding cardinal and adding the "ra" suffix (except for thoro (1st in inanimate))(some numbers, such as ra'ara are ambiguous between animate cardinal and animate ordinal, in this case 86 or 14th, but, because of context, this isn't an issue).

The following is every number from 0-100 for context on how it works:
