1. Pronouns
	1. Gender invariant
	2. Number invariant; use "qae"(many) to emphasize plurality, ie. "a qae" means "we"
2. Tenses
	1. past perfect (-u)
		any non-recurring past event
	2. past imperfect (-va) (pronounced /w̃a/ rather than /ũa/ when following a single consonant)
		any recurring event that is no longer continuing
	3. present perfect (-o)
		anything that is both ongoing and non-repeating
	4. present imperfect (-ua)
		anything that happens repetitively or constantly and is on-going
	5. simple future (-a)
		anything that has yet to begin, even if it will repeat
	6. conditional then-clause (-e)
		any verb in a then-clause of an if/then has this conjugation
3. Animacy prefixes
	1. Goes before verbs to denote the animacy of the subject and object
	2. if adding the prefix causes two vowels to be in a row, a glottal stop is inserted in between,
	3. animate subject and object (wa-)
	4. animate subject, inanimate object (owa-)
	5. inanimate subject, animate object (awo-)
	6. inanimate subject and object (wo-)
4. Verb structure
	1. Verbs are conjugate for tense and animacy of the subject and object
	2. Verbs are in the form of prefix+root+suffix from conjugation
	3. verb roots always end with consonants, never a vowel
	4. the infinitive is root+ur
	5. Example with orq (to see):    
	    1. waorqu (saw once animate subject and object)
        2. owaorqvu (animate subject continuously saw inanimate object)
        3. waorqo (sees) (animate subject and object)
        4. waorqa (will see) (animate subject and object)
        5. owaorqea (would see) (animate subject, inanimate object)
        6. waorqua (habitually sees) (animate subject and object)
5. Nouns and Adjectives
	1. Nouns can be animate or inanimate, which affects what numbers are used to count them and whether they're referred to by "u" (they/them) or "e" (it/them)
	2. Verbs can be used to construct nouns about the abstract concept of their existence by adding -uqa, ie. anuqa means love as a noun
		These are always in the animate form
	2. Nouns do not inflect for number or case
	3. Adjectives always follow the noun they modify and are invariant
6. Adverbs
	1. Adverbs come after the verb and can be constructed by changing the “-e” at the end of an adjective to the suffix used in conjugating the verb, they can also be 
		  Example: “wa'amua zelenzua” (habitually loves silently (animate subject and object))
7. Syntax
	1. SOV order (subject object verb), ie. "a tu tara wavnqo  – "I/we go to the fire."
	2. Adjectives follow nouns
	3. Adverbs follow verbs
	4. Prepositions precede nouns
	5. Negation can be indicated using the word "ne" (means "no/not/don't/nothing"); double negatives are not permitted, ie. "a o ne wa'anu
	6. ./a" (I don't love you)
	7. Questions are formed by changing to VSO order and raising pitch towards the end of the sentence
	8. Wishes and requests are conjugated in the conditional
8. Connecting Clauses
	   1. Coordinating Conjunctions
		Rule: Two independent clauses can be connected, conjunctions are allowed, but often just juxtaposition is allowed
		Example: “a tu lvngo owavnqo ra a doze wazua.”  (I go to the fire because I am tired) or "a tu lvngo owavnqo a doze wazua." (the same, without the "because") are equivalent, with the later being less explicit
	2. Subordinating Conjunctions
		Rule: A dependent clause can be introduced with a subordinating conjunction that precedes the clause.
		Example: “a tu tara wavnqe qu a {work} {finish}.” (I will go to the fire if I finish work)
	3. Relative Pronouns
		Rule: A relative clause can be introduced with a relative pronoun that follows the noun it modifies.
		Example: “{The} {book} {that} {I} {wrote} {interesting} {is}.” (the book that I wrote is interesting)
	4. Conjunctive Adverbs
		Rule: Two independent clauses can be connected by a conjunctive adverb, which follows a semicolon or period.
		Example: “{I} {to go} {wanted}; {however}, {it} {to rain} {started}.” (I wanted to go; however, it started to rain)
	5. Ellipsis
		Rule: Elements that are repeated in connected clauses can be omitted to avoid redundancy.
		Example: “{I} {apples} {like}, {and} {they} {also}.” (I like apples, they do too)
	6. Asyndeton
		Rule: Omitting conjunctions between clauses for conciseness is allowed; use commas to separate.
		Example: “a wavnqu, a wazalu, a wawengqu.” (I came, I saw, I conquered)
	7. Infinitive Phrases
		Rule: Infinitive phrases can indicate purpose or intent and follow the main clause.
		Example: “a {study} {hard} je zucur.” (I study hard to succeed)
	8. Parenthetical Phrases
		Rule: Parenthetical information can be inserted into a sentence, set off by commas.
		Example: “qhurez, du qheldun, tadur wazua.” (Qhurez, the doctor, is visiting)
